\section{An Interesting Section}
\label{section:interesting_section}

Great thoughts that further your argument. This includes lots of strong evidence presented throughout several paragraphs, each accompanied by necessary citations.
\begin{quotation}
    \noindent Here is a block quotation---a passage from a text you found insightful and wanted to share with others. Maybe it is from a journal article, website, or book. Irrespective, it should support the argument being made.\footnote{A citation for the quoted material.}
\end{quotation}

Maybe a sentence or two that bring the argument and evidence together.\citep{dos_santos_2020}

This is how you refer to subsection \ref{section:another_interesting_section}

Check appendix \ref{appendix: chapter1}
